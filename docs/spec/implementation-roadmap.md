# Step-by-step implementation roadmap

[Specification index](README.md)

## 1. Program expectations

Full vMix Pro/Max-class parity is a multi-year broadcast product program, not a
single MVP. A realistic broad-parity effort is roughly 12–18 experienced
engineers over 30–42 months, plus product/design, QA/hardware lab, release,
security, legal/licensing, and vendor relationships. A smaller team should keep
the same phase order but narrow certified devices and overlap less.

Phases ship vertical slices. Do not build every input before one end-to-end
camera-to-display-to-record path is reliable.

## 2. Phase 0 — feasibility and constraints (6–10 weeks)

Build disposable prototypes, not production abstractions.

1. Prove one 1080p60 camera/file frame can enter D3D12, Metal, and Vulkan wgpu
   paths, composite, display, and export to a hardware encoder.
2. Measure copy count, latency, GPU/CPU use, and device-loss behavior.
3. Prototype 48 kHz capture/mix/output on all three OSes.
4. Record and stream one hardware-encoded rendition with recoverable container.
5. Prototype engine/studio process separation and local shared preview.
6. Validate FFmpeg/GStreamer/vendor SDK redistribution and codec patent posture.
7. Acquire representative GPU, capture, audio, controller, and storage hardware.
8. Freeze the vMix 29 compatibility ledger and tag every row with acceptance
   owner and applicable platform.

Exit:

- architecture decision records for media stack, GPU interop, wire schema, UI,
  and plugin ABI;
- measured prototype report on all Tier-1 OSes;
- approved licensing plan;
- no unresolved blocker to a two-frame-class HD path.

## 3. Phase 1 — foundation and simulated engine (8–10 weeks)

1. Create workspace, dependency policy, CI, `xtask`, and binary skeletons.
2. Implement `fm-types`, IDs, formats, time/rates, color/audio metadata.
3. Implement project schema, migration harness, journal, atomic save.
4. Implement commands, events, revisions, idempotency, transactions.
5. Implement capability registry and compatibility report.
6. Materialize `parity.toml` from the ledger with phase, owning workstream,
   dependencies, platform/capability profile, and acceptance-test IDs; CI rejects
   missing or duplicate mappings.
7. Implement editable graph, validation, plan representation, bounded budgets.
8. Implement deterministic clock, fake video/audio sources/sinks, and scheduler.
9. Implement server handshake, snapshot/event resume, auth development mode.
10. Implement UI replicated model and a diagnostic client.
11. Add golden protocol/project fixtures and simulated end-to-end tests.

Exit: a headless simulated production can be controlled by CLI and client,
saved, restarted, resumed, and tested deterministically.

## 4. Phase 2 — GPU playback switcher (10–14 weeks)

1. Build wgpu context, resource pools, shader validation, render graph.
2. Add image, color/bars, and file playback through the codec adapter.
3. Implement preview/program, Cut/Fade, frame-boundary command realization.
4. Implement transforms, crop, opacity, layers, and basic color conversion.
5. Build native studio shell, input tiles, Program/Preview, transition controls.
6. Present local previews without CPU readback where possible.
7. Add planar float audio playback, Master bus, meters, gain/mute/follow-video.
8. Add fullscreen output and one fault-tolerant program recorder.
9. Instrument latency, queue depth, frame drops, and GPU time.
10. Pass the first one-hour Basic Show scenario on each Tier-1 OS.

Exit: a useful offline/file-based switcher, with no engine dependency on UI
lifecycle.

## 5. Phase 3 — live capture and professional core (12–16 weeks)

1. Add OS camera, audio, and screen/window capture adapters.
2. Implement source hot-plug, signal loss/fallback, timestamp validation.
3. Implement audio device clocks, drift correction, channel mapping, delay,
   native EQ/gate/compressor/limiter.
4. Add scenes with background plus ten layers, keys, masks, and effect stack.
5. Complete standard transitions, AlphaFade, T-bar, FTB.
6. Add eight overlay channels, stinger preload/cut point, per-output inclusion.
7. Add two multiviews, labels, tally, audio meters, safe areas.
8. Add scopes and professional color correction.
9. Add shortcuts and initial MIDI/OSC/controller support.
10. Certify Profile A without network contribution.

Exit: `P0` switcher, composition, audio, display, record, and control rows pass.

## 6. Phase 4 — output, stream, and headless reliability (10–14 weeks)

1. Add RTMP/RTMPS and SRT outputs with independent state.
2. Add five simultaneous destinations and shared-rendition planning.
3. Add multi-bitrate output and local HLS/LiveLAN equivalent.
4. Add second program recorder, segment rules, WAV/multichannel audio.
5. Add ISO/MultiCorder graph taps and timecode manifest.
6. Implement the per-user `freemix-capture-node` and certify service-to-session
   screen/camera/application-audio permission, clock, reconnect, and logout
   behavior.
7. Implement engine OS service mode, health/readiness, support bundles.
8. Implement remote browser control, WebRTC multiview preview, roles/pairing.
9. Add disk/network/GPU preflight and alert policy.
10. Run process-kill, disk-full, network impairment, and 24-hour soak.
11. Publish the first supported hardware/capability matrix.

Exit: a remote-controlled headless production can stream and record
independently with tested recovery.

## 7. Phase 5 — graphics, data, automation, and ecosystem controls (12–16 weeks)

1. Implement title scene model, text shaping, images/shapes, animation/tickers.
2. Build title designer and live field editor.
3. Add isolated browser input with audio, interaction, custom CSS, and network
   policy.
4. Add data sources and typed field mapping.
5. Implement PlayList scheduling and per-input programmed GO.
6. Implement the complete trigger catalog, macro transactions, timers,
   conditions, cancellation.

   to legal platform scope.
2. Add vMix HTTP/TCP/tally compatibility adapter.

8. Freeze 1.0 project/plugin/protocol compatibility policy.

Exit: no unclassified vMix 29 public feature and no incomplete P0/P1/P2 row
without a documented legal/platform exception.

## 12. Workstream ownership

Suggested durable teams:

- media core and clocks;
- GPU/compositor/color;
- audio/DSP;
- codecs/network/recording;
- platform and professional hardware;
- engine/control/persistence/security;
- studio/web UX;
- graphics/data/automation/plugins;
- replay/guests;
- QA automation and hardware lab.

Crate ownership follows these boundaries. Cross-team APIs are reviewed through
small executable conformance tests, not a giant shared facade.

## 13. First backlog, in order

1. Create capability ledger machine-readable schema.
2. Write ADTs for frame rate, timebase, color, channel layout, memory domain.
3. Write command/event/revision state-machine tests.
4. Write simulated clock and frame generator.
5. Write graph validation and bounded resource planner.
6. Build one platform camera/file adapter behind `fm-io-api`.
7. Build one wgpu composite-to-display path.
8. Build one audio capture-to-output path.
9. Connect Cut/Fade command through server to a scheduled frame.
10. Save/restart/recover the project.
11. Add one program recorder and process-kill recovery test.
12. Port the vertical slice to the other two Tier-1 OSes before adding breadth.

## 14. Scope control

At each phase:

- update the parity ledger;
- publish measured capability support;
- carry no “temporary” unbounded queues or UI-owned engine state;
- retire prototypes before stabilizing public APIs;
- require a fallback/failure policy for every new source and sink; and
- prioritize a reliable vertical path over a long list of half-integrated
  adapters.

## 15. Machine-checkable traceability

`feature-parity.md` is the reader-facing contract. Before Phase 1 closes,
`parity.toml` becomes the executable ledger. Each `IN-*`, `SW-*`, `GX-*`,
`AU-*`, `OR-*`, and `RC-*` ID must define:

```toml
id = "IN-013"
priority = "P1"
phase = 5
owner = "graphics-data-automation"
dependencies = ["gpu.browser-surface", "security.browser-sandbox"]
capability_profiles = ["windows-tier1", "macos-tier1", "linux-tier1"]
tests = ["browser-input-html5-audio", "browser-input-css", "browser-input-crash"]
```

`xtask parity check` fails when a Markdown ID lacks a record, a test ID is
unknown, a phase exit claims an incomplete dependency, or a release includes an
unwaived applicable row. Named proprietary integrations may be legally blocked
but cannot be marked parity-complete through a generic substitute.
